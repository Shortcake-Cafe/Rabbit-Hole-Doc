# Dev Environment

Extensions are best developed in a proper environment. This will allow you to run code in a live console and test in real-time.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) (`npm install -g http-server`)
- The [Rabbit Hole source code](https://github.com/Shortcake-Cafe/Rabbit-Hole)
  - The repository explains this, but it is an `sb3` file that you can open in the [TurboWarp Editor](https://turbowarp.org/editor).
  - This isn't *required* for development, but it is very handy for seeing what you're working with.

## Setup

1. Open the app directory found at `Rabbit Hole/resources/app`.

2. Open a terminal in the app directory.

3. Run `http-server` in the terminal. This will start a local server that you can use as a live console.
   - By default, this server runs at http://127.0.0.1:8081
