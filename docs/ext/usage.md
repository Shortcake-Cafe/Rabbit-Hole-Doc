# Usage

Before you can do any modding, or if you're just here to install extensions, you will need to download and use the extension injector. Instructions and information can be found below.

## Requirements

- [Rabbit Hole](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2831340/Rabbit_Hole/)
- Windows 10+ 64-bit

## Instructions

1. Download the <a href="https://github.com/AshtonMemer/rabbit-hole-injector/releases/download/v0.1/rh-injector.zip" download>injector zip file</a>.
2. Extract the injector and `extensions` folder into the root of the Rabbit Hole game directory.
3. Place any [extensions](#extensions) into the new `extensions` directory.
4. Run the injector. This will open an interface allowing you to inject extensions and restore the game to its original state.
5. Use the injector to load the extensions into Rabbit Hole.
6. Launch the game through Steam like normal!

:::note

If the injector is not starting properly or you are having issues, try replacing your `injector.exe` with the <a href="../injector-compatibility.exe" download="injector.exe">compatibility version</a>.

## Extensions

Here's a comprehensive list of available extensions:

- <a href="../extensions/Interop.js" download="Interop.js">Interop</a> - Used for interaction with Scratch. This is required for all extensions, and is included with the injector. If you do not include this in your extensions directory, other extensions will not work correctly.

- <a href="../extensions/QuickerRestart.js" download="QuickerRestart.js">QuickerRestart</a> - Quickly restart your run with the press of a button (<code>`</code>), even if you are in the middle of a fight.

I will continue to add extensions here as they are created. If you have an extension you would like to add, please contact me.
