# Introduction

This section of the documentation is dedicated to creating and using **Extensions** for Rabbit Hole. If you are looking for the game code, please refer to the [Scratch Docs](/introduction) instead.

If you are only here for installing and using extensions, you can skip straight to the [Usage](/ext/usage) section.

This section is written and maintained by AshtonMemer, so please contact me at Discord @ `AshtonMemer` if you have any questions.

## What is an Extension?

Extensions differ from regular modding. They are a way to modify the game without cloning or changing the game's code. This is done by creating a script that is loaded by the game with an injector. These scripts can work alongside each other and directly with the Steam version of the game, allowing for more versatility and compatibility.

## What should I go with?

There are some key differences between Scratch Mods and Extensions. Here is a table to help you decide which one to go with:

| Scratch Mod                | Extension                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Written in Scratch         | Written in JavaScript      |
| Standalone game            | Extends the Steam game     |
| Allows for native code     | Work with existing code    |
| Stuck on developed version | Works with future versions |
| Cannot mix-and-match       | Supports other extensions  |
| Simple dev environment     | Complex dev environment    |

If you are unfamiliar with JavaScript or are looking to create something very complex, you should probably go with a Scratch Mod. However, if you are looking to create something that users can easily install and use on the Steam version of the game without having to install a separate build of Rabbit Hole, you should go with an Extension.
