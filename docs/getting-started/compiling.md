# Compiling the game

1. Go to the [TurboWarp Packager](https://packager.turbowarp.org/).

2. Select **File** and choose **Rabbit Hole.sb3**.

3. Wait for the file to be compressed.

:::note

    To save time, I recommend you use the settings already provided in your download.
    Scroll down to the very bottom, press **Import Settings** and upload `turbowarp-packager-settings.json`.

:::

4. Pick your environment and press **Package**!

   - The browser version of Rabbit Hole just uses **Plain HTML**
   - The steam version uses **Electron Windows application (64-bit only)**

:::warning

    Rabbit Hole has a tendency to crash when picking **Electron Windows application (32-bit or 64-bit)**.
