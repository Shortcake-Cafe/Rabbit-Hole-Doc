# Installation & Setup

Rabbit Hole is an `sb3` file, which means it is a Scratch game. Here are the steps to get it compiled into a usable format.

:::tip

    If you downloaded the source code from the google drive, skip to [opening the file](#opening-the-file).

:::

## Compiling an sb3

If you downloaded the source code from GitHub, you'll notice that it isn't yet in sb3 format. \
That's because we have to **turn the entire folder into the sb3** to open it in TurboWarp.\
\
The process is simple, so don't worry:

1. Compress /Rabbit Hole into a zip file.
2. Rename zip file to Rabbit Hole.sb3

*That's it!*

## Opening the file

1. Go to the [TurboWarp Editor](https://turbowarp.org/editor).

:::note

    It is **highly recommended** you download a few addons to properly navigate and mod the source code:
    
    1. Go to **Addons > Import settings** and upload the `turbowarp-addon-settings.json` file that is included in the source code.
    2. Return to the editor and refresh the page.

:::

2. Load **Rabbit Hole.sb3** in Turbowarp, **File > Load from your computer**.
